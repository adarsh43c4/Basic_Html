     OPERATION SINDOOR </u></center></h1>
    <p><h3>On 7 May 2025, India conducted missile strikes on Pakistan and in the disputed Pakistan occupied kashmir, codenamed Operation Sindoor.[49][50] It was launched in response to the alleged Pakistan-sponsored terrorist attack on Tourists in Pahalgam.[51]

The terror attack was religiously motivated, since tourists were asked to recite the kalma, and their private parts were checked to ensure they were muslim. Non-muslims were all killed.[52][53]

India responded that it has a firm resolution to fight terrorism, and launched Operation Sindoor.[54] It involved coordinated strikes by the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force, marking one of the most significant tri-services missions in recent years.[55] The name Sindoor symbolizes marriage and the safety of husbands in Hindu culture.

The primary goal of Operation Sindoor was to eliminate the terrorist camps, hideouts and dismantle the infrastructure used by terrorist militant groups that were supported, funded, trained and sheltered by Pakistan.[56] The operation was carried out simultaneously with pin-point precision and speed, targeting multiple locations across the LoC.[57] On 10 May 2025, reportedly at the request of government of Pakistan, a ceasefire, mediated by the United States was announced. Later that day, Pakistan claimed victory even though at the time of ceasefire, India was considered to have an upper hand. Pakistan is said to have broken the ceasefire mere hours later. [58][59]

As Part of Operation Sindoor, India killed more than a 100 terrorists.[60] Later, it was seen that Pakistani soldiers were attending the funerals of such alleged terrorists.[61]

Pakistan army retaliated by attacking border cities of India and targeting civilian sites.[62] India attacked 11 air bases of Pakistan air force and destroyed them.[63] Pakistan attacked India with heavy swarm of drones and a few missiles and fighter jets.[64] All of Pakistan attacks were neutralized.[65] India shot down Pakistan 5 fighter planes. Pakistan allegedly asked the US to intervene and help and India agreed for a ceasefire as per United States intervention.</h3>

<h3>On 8 May, India said that Pakistan had launched drone and missile strikes on several Indian cities, including Amritsar, and that India negated these strikes by the S-400 missile system, denominated as Sudarshan Chakra marking India's first combat use of the that missile system.[93] The Indian government said it was "compelled to respond to bring Mortar and Artillery fire from Pakistan to a halt".[94] However, Pakistan denied these claims and reported that the Indian Army mistakenly struck itself in Amritsar and blamed it on Pakistan to fuel anti-Pakistan sentiment among Sikh people.[95] Pakistan also denied launching a drone and missile strike on India.[96]

In response to the alleged Pakistani attack, Indian Armed Forces said that they had carried out SEAD/DEAD operations, neutralizing Pakistani air defence systems in Lahore. Pakistani authorities said that several Indian drones intruded in Pakistani airspace, and 12 Indian drones were shot down. As per Pakistan, these drones were sent into nine different locations including the cities of Karachi and Lahore, and one of the drones struck a Pakistani military facility near Lahore.[97][98] The Pakistani military later said to have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop loitering munitions in the Pakistani side of the border, an Indian government source confirmed at least one
 of those being taken down.[99][100] A drone also landed inside the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium complex before the start of a Pakistan Super League match, prompting the Pakistan Cricket Board to transfer the games to the United Arab Emirates.
